# Xsitor.Legacy
The Legacy (and the original) version of Xsitor - A video search engine

Xsitor is a Adult Video search engine developed by Ascalonic, first released on July 2018. The original version is a basic scrapper
that, based on the search query given, collects video results from multiple porn sites and presents before the user. It also has an iconic
**direct download** feature that instantly scraps the original MP4 video being streamed and downloads it through browser.

The scrapper for the legacy version uses BeautifulSoup. The results from the sites are cross-ranked using a basic algorithm, that wasn't 
proved to be much efficient in the original xsitor. Since February, 2019, Ascalonic has been working on a new version written
in C# with a powerful algorithm and advanced features, which will be released within a month.
